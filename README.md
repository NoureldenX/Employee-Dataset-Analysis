# Employee Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes an Employee dataset to explore relationships between age, joining year, payment tier, education, and work experience.  
The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal is to understand trends and patterns in the dataset, focusing on:  
- Distribution of employees across different payment tiers.  
- Age and joining year relationships.  
- Education and domain experience.  
- General workforce characteristics.  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **File:** Employee.csv  
- **Features:**  
  - `Age` → Age of employee  
  - `JoiningYear` → Year employee joined  
  - `PaymentTier` → Salary tier (1, 2, 3)  
  - `Education` → Education level  
  - `EverBenched` → If employee was benched (Yes/No)  
  - `ExperienceInCurrentDomain` → Years of experience in current domain

## 🛠️ Methods
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values by replacing with `0`.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Descriptive statistics.  
   - Value counts for categorical variables.  

3. **Visualizations**  
   - Countplots of Payment Tier vs Joining Year.  
   - Histograms for Payment Tier distribution.  
   - Boxplots for Age vs Joining Year and Payment Tier.  
   - Pie chart distribution by Joining Year.  

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Different payment tiers show varying distribution across joining years.  
- Age distribution varies by year of joining.  
- Payment tier patterns suggest differences in workforce structure.  
- Visualization highlights useful workforce characteristics.
